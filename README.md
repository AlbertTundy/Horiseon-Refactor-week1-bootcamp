# Horiseon-Refactor-week1-bootcamp

Horiseon web page

This is a mock website for a company named "Horiseon" while I didn't create the origional code I did refactor it to help with my general knowledge of semantic Elements and html code in general.
The web page it's self is a fairly straight forward html page styled with css. However I did manage to have some difficulties renaming div and fixing one of the links on the top.
